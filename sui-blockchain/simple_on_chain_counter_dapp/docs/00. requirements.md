# Sui Bootcamp Homework Assignment

### Simple On-Chain Counter DApp

## Objective

Create a decentralized counter application where users can create their own personal counter
and increment it on-chain. This exercise will test your understanding of Sui Move objects,
ownership, and basic transaction handling.

## Project Requirements

### Move Module for Counter

Implement a Move module with the following functionality:

#### Core Features:

- Create a `Counter` object that stores:
  - Owner address
  - Current count value (starting at 0)
  - Creation timestamp

- Implement functions to:
  - `create_counter()` - Creates a new Counter object owned by the caller
  - `increment()` - Increases the counter value by 1
  - `get_value()` - Returns the current counter value (read-only)

#### Technical Requirements:
- Counter must be a Sui object with `key` ability
- Properly handle object ownership
- Include basic error handling
- Add appropriate events for counter creation and increments

## Deployment
- Deploy your module to Sui Testnet
- Verify the contract is published successfully

## Submission Requirements
Submit the following:
1. **Transaction Hash or Package ID (Required)**
   - The publish transaction hash from Sui Testnet or the package ID

2. **GitHub Repository (Required)**
   - Public repository containing your Move code
   - Include a `README.md` with:
     - Package deployment ID
     - Instructions to build the contract
     - Brief explanation of your implementation
