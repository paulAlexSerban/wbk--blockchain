- [x] **Error Handling**
  - [x] `ECounterOverflow` error constant
  - [x] Overflow protection in increment function
  - [x] Owner verification

- [x] **Object Ownership**
  - [x] Proper use of `transfer::transfer()`
  - [x] Counter object owned by creator
  - [x] Only owner can increment their counter
